Hello community member,

Hope you're doing well! We're currently in the process of validating the identities of members in the IITG Startup WhatsApp group to ensure it remains focused and relevant to the IIT Guwahati community.

Could you kindly share the following details by messaging Shomesh (+1 669-214-8103) directly on WhatsApp:

1. Your full name (if not in your profile)
2. Your affiliation with IITG (alumnus/a, faculty, etc.)
3. Your involvement in the startup ecosystem (founder, team member, investor, or aspiring to be one)
4. Your LinkedIn profile link

We'd really appreciate your response within the next 24 hrs. If we don't hear back, we may temporarily remove your number, but you're always welcome to reach out to Shomesh to be added back once verified.

Thanks so much for your understanding and support!

Warm regards,
Community Member
