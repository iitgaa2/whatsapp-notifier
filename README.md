## üñºÔ∏è WhatsApp Screenshot Format

The script expects WhatsApp group participant screenshots with this format:
```
~ Rajesh Kumar
+91 98765 43210

~ Priya Sharma  
+91 87654 32109

~ Dr. Amit Singh
+1 (555) 123-4567
```

**Tips for better OCR results:**
- High resolution screenshots (1080p or higher)
- Good contrast (dark text on light background)
- Avoid blurry or cropped images
- PNG or JPG format
- Full contact names and phone numbers visible

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize for your IITG group:

```python
# Message timing (be respectful)
MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_MESSAGES = 10  # seconds
MAX_DELAY_BETWEEN_MESSAGES = 30  # seconds

# Browser settings
HEADLESS_MODE = False  # Set True for server deployment
CHROME_PROFILE_PATH = None  # Set path for session persistence

# OCR settings (optimized for WhatsApp screenshots)
TESSERACT_CONFIG = '--oem 3 --psm 6'

# Phone validation (international alumni)
DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODE = "IN"  # India, but supports international
```

## üîê IITG Alumni Group Guidelines

### Rate Limiting & Best Practices
- **Built-in delays**: 10-30 seconds between messages
- **Recommended frequency**: Use only when needed for verification
- **Batch size**: 10-15 contacts per session maximum
- **Time of use**: Respect time zones of international alumni

### Alumni Community Standards
- ‚úÖ Only use for legitimate IITG alumni groups
- ‚úÖ Verify only in groups you administer
- ‚úÖ Use for community building and verification
- ‚úÖ Respect privacy and alumni preferences
- ‚ùå Don't send promotional or commercial messages
- ‚ùå Don't exceed reasonable verification frequencies
- ‚ùå Don't use for non-IITG related groups

### Verification Process Compliance
- Ensure you have admin rights in the group
- Only verify members who joined through IITG networks
- Maintain confidentiality of verification responses
- Follow up appropriately with verified members

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Local Processing**: All OCR and contact extraction happens locally
- **No Data Storage**: Contact information is not permanently stored
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for accountability
- **Session Security**: WhatsApp sessions are local and secure

### IITG Alumni Privacy
- Verification messages include clear opt-out information
- Contact information is used only for verification purposes
- Compliance with alumni association privacy standards
- Transparent about data usage and verification process

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Alumni Verification Issues

**1. "No contacts found in WhatsApp screenshot"**
- Ensure screenshot shows participant list clearly
- Check image quality and contrast
- Verify contact names and numbers are visible
- Try cropping to focus on participant list

**2. "Verification message not personalized correctly"**
- Check that `{name}` placeholder is in template
- Verify OCR extracted names correctly
- Review logs for name extraction issues

**3. "WhatsApp Web automation failed"**
- Ensure you're logged into WhatsApp Web as group admin
- Check Chrome browser is updated
- Verify group admin permissions
- Check internet connectivity

**4. "Rate limiting or account restrictions"**
- Reduce message frequency (increase delays)
- Use smaller batches (5-10 contacts)
- Wait between verification sessions
- Ensure messages comply with WhatsApp terms

### Debug Mode for Alumni Admins
```bash
# Test verification flow without sending
uv run python main.py --interactive --dry-run

# Check OCR extraction quality
uv run python -c "from ocr_extractor import ContactExtractor; print(ContactExtractor().preview_ocr_result('your_screenshot.png'))"
```
